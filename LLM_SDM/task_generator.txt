You are an expert developing an intelligent battery management system. 
Analyze the system performance and provde strategic direction.

Current Implementation:
''' python
{code}
'''

Peformance Data:
- Battery levels: {battery_level_record}
- Charge/discharge action: {action_record}
- Time-based costs: {cost_per_time_record}
- Current total cost: {total_cost}
- Historical total costs: {total_cost_record}

Provide:
1. Key performance insights (2-3 points)
2. Strategic direction: continous or pivot
3. High-level imporvement areas
